# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project analysis was to design an HTML page where we could filter UFO data using JavaScript. The data was stored as a JavaScript file, so the data was pulled from that data, and we used a background image from a website. The tools used for this project are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for styling. The purpose of using JavaScript was for to create something that would be interactive for the end  user.

## Results

Someone who is interested in UFO data might use the new webpage by entering a date, city, state, country, and/or shape as the search criteria. The user would just need to enter the information in the same format as the default value on the page and if there is any data available from teh criteria they chose, the search results will appear.

## Summary

While the page we created is effective in providing a user with plenty of data on UFO sightings, it could be more user-friendly by automatically refreshing the page if the user wanted to input new criteria. As the page is currently set up, the user will have to manually refresh the page.
### Additional Recommentations
* We could add more images on the website where applicable. If these UFO sightings have any images or any visual representations, those could be added to the page to make the page more interesting to users.
* The other suggestion would be to add a link to the search results so the user can take a screen shot of a specific sighting so they can have only that information, rather information on other sightings they may not be interested in.
* Lastly, if we could provide additional location details regarding the sightings, users would be able to map out the recording sightings to see if they can determine any patterns, and create accurate visualizations for the data available.
